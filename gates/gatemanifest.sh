# THE EXPECTED-GATES CHECK. Shipped #461 for
# jobs/gates-green-does-not-assert-which-gates-RAN-so-a-deleted-gate-is-invisible-2026-10-01, found by
# antagonist B on #450 ("this is B's best finding and it is better than the fix it was reviewing").
#
# THE DEFECT IT CLOSES, in one sentence: gates.sh globs gates/regress/*.js, so it asserts that the gates PRESENT
# all passed and never that the gates that MATTER were present - a deleted, renamed or never-merged gate is
# indistinguishable from a gate that was never needed, and the suite still ends GATES GREEN.
#
# THE SHAPE, AND WHY IT IS NOT ONE SINGLE VERDICT. Two different failures need two different answers, and giving
# them the same answer is what makes a guard unusable:
#   MISSING  (state=required, file not on disk) -> HARD. Exit 1, and gates.sh refuses to run a single gate.
#            Nothing legitimate produces this: a gate only leaves the required set through `retire`, which writes
#            the reason into the manifest so the removal lands in a commit diff with its justification attached.
#   UNLISTED (file on disk, no row at all)      -> SOFT. Exit 2. The suite still RUNS, because a build that adds
#            a gate must be able to run it, and a hard failure here would mean every new gate reddens its own
#            first suite. But it is NOT a silence either: the count goes in the log footer and
#            gates/verify-log.sh REFUSES a log carrying one, so a gate cannot reach main without a row.
# That asymmetry is the same one gates/verify-log.sh already draws between its default checks and --this-bundle,
# and for the same reason: a guard that fires on the normal case gets switched off.
#
# WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, SAID HERE RATHER THAN DISCOVERED LATER [#419, "a gate log's footer cannot vouch for the
# file it was derived from"]. The summary line this script writes into the log is computed by this script, so
# verify-log.sh reading it back is reading a CLAIM, not an independent measurement - exactly as the PASS-count
# footer is. It cannot be otherwise: verify-log.sh is routinely run on archived logs with no matching tree on
# disk, so it has nothing to re-derive from. What this buys is that the claim now EXISTS and is checkable by
# anyone with the tree; what protects a log's provenance remains the suite lock, not anything in this file.
