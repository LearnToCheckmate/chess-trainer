# gates/gates.sh "#373"                          THE GATE IS ONE SCRIPT (supervisor ruling, HANDOFF 0c).
# gates/gates.sh "#373" "20-review 21-review-brilliant"    a SUBSET, for the iteration loop only.
#
# Runs gates/mountcheck.js FIRST (HANDOFF gate 3: it catches a stale or unmountable bundle in seconds), then every
# gates/regress/*.js in name order, one at a time with nothing else running (measurements are timing-sensitive).
# Each gate's output goes to gates/logs/<N>-<gate>.log and all of it to gates/logs/<N>-all.log. Exit 1 on any FAIL
# line, any "<<<" marker, or a non-zero exit. The footer prints the PASS-line count (the charter's "regression
# assertions" number, must only rise) and GATES GREEN / GATES RED. A build is "gated" only when the log ends GREEN.
#   CT_EXPECT is passed to mountcheck as the stamp the bundle must carry (defaults to $1).
#
# ── #391, procedure 6e item 1. SUBSET RUNS, AND THE ONE RULE THAT MATTERS ─────────────────────────────────────
# $2 is an optional space-separated list of gate basenames (globs allowed: "3*" or "20-review 4*"). Unset means
# every gate, exactly as before, so nothing that exists changes behaviour. mountcheck ALWAYS runs.
#
# **A SUBSET RUN NEVER AUTHORISES A PUSH.** It is for diagnosing a red, checking a fix, or proving a new gate.
# The full suite still runs from the top before every push.
#
# The guard is not a comment, it is mechanical: a subset run CANNOT EMIT THE STRING "GATES GREEN". Every consumer
# in this project greps for exactly that - this session does it dozens of times a day - so a subset log is
# unusable as a push gate by every reader that already exists, including ones nobody remembers to update. A
# subset also writes to a DIFFERENT FILE (<N>-subset-all.log) so it can never overwrite or be mistaken for the
# full log, and its header and footer both say so. `gates/verify-log.sh <log>` is the one place that decides
# whether a log authorises a push; run it on any log before citing one.
#
# Why this exists: an external challenger caught a log footed "GATES GREEN #387" filed under a 388-all.log name
# (fixed at #389, see claude/agents/gatelogs/README.md). A subset log passed off as a full one is that same
# failure with a far bigger blast radius, because a subset can be green while the gate that would have caught
# the regression never ran at all.
