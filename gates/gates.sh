# gates/gates.sh "#373"                          THE GATE IS ONE SCRIPT (supervisor ruling, HANDOFF 0c).
# gates/gates.sh "#373" "20-review 21-review-brilliant"    a SUBSET, for the iteration loop only.
#
# Runs gates/mountcheck.js FIRST (HANDOFF gate 3: it catches a stale or unmountable bundle in seconds), then every
# gates/regress/*.js in name order, one at a time with nothing else running (measurements are timing-sensitive).
# Each gate's output goes to gates/logs/<N>-<gate>.log and all of it to gates/logs/<N>-all.log. Exit 1 on any FAIL
# line, any "<<<" marker, or a non-zero exit. The footer prints the PASS-line count (the charter's "regression
# assertions" number, must only rise) and GATES GREEN / GATES RED. A build is "gated" only when the log ends GREEN.
#   CT_EXPECT is passed to mountcheck as the stamp the bundle must carry (defaults to $1).
#
# ── #391, procedure 6e item 1. SUBSET RUNS, AND THE ONE RULE THAT MATTERS ─────────────────────────────────────
# $2 is an optional space-separated list of gate basenames (globs allowed: "3*" or "20-review 4*"). Unset means
# every gate, exactly as before, so nothing that exists changes behaviour. mountcheck ALWAYS runs.
#
# **A SUBSET RUN NEVER AUTHORISES A PUSH.** It is for diagnosing a red, checking a fix, or proving a new gate.
# The full suite still runs from the top before every push.
#
# The guard is not a comment, it is mechanical: a subset run CANNOT EMIT THE STRING "GATES GREEN". Every consumer
# in this project greps for exactly that - this session does it dozens of times a day - so a subset log is
# unusable as a push gate by every reader that already exists, including ones nobody remembers to update. A
# subset also writes to a DIFFERENT FILE (<N>-subset-all.log) so it can never overwrite or be mistaken for the
# full log, and its header and footer both say so. `gates/verify-log.sh <log>` is the one place that decides
# whether a log authorises a push; run it on any log before citing one.
#
# Why this exists: an external challenger caught a log footed "GATES GREEN #387" filed under a 388-all.log name
# (fixed at #389, see claude/agents/gatelogs/README.md). A subset log passed off as a full one is that same
# failure with a far bigger blast radius, because a subset can be green while the gate that would have caught
# the regression never ran at all.

# The log name came from the build TAG alone, so two passes gating the SAME bundle wrote the same file and the
# second silently destroyed the first. That is not hypothetical: #401 and #402 both re-gated the unchanged #400
# bundle, #402's run overwrote #401's log, and STANDING CHECKS A (2026-09-16-08, check C2-2) then reported the
# executed evidence for HEAD as UNKNOWN - correctly, because no committed log covered either pass even though the
# full suite had been run and verified twice. A record that cannot distinguish two runs of the same bundle is the
# same defect class as the frozen denominator and the three-places control record.
# The repo's own committed names already show the convention this restores by hand: 381b, 381c, 381d, 382b, 383b.
# Subset logs are deliberately still overwritten - they are the iteration loop and must never accumulate.
# ── ONE SUITE AT A TIME (#419) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# #418 ran TWO full suites ten seconds apart against the same bundle. The -all.log guard below did its job and
# gave them separate names (418b, 418c), so BOTH looked like clean full-suite greens and one was accepted by
# verify-log.sh at 1935 PASS. They were not two runs: 26 of their 36 gate sections are BYTE-IDENTICAL, including
# 49-home at 53,951 bytes, because the per-gate log path had no run identity and both processes were reading and
# writing the same 36 files. Each -all.log is a COLLAGE of two runs, and 418b carries an 18KB hole of NUL bytes
# where it read a file the other process was mid-write. Nothing detected this: the footer total is computed FROM
# the collage, so self-consistency holds by construction - the check and the thing checked were the same object,
# which is this project's oldest trap wearing a new costume.
# Two concurrent suites are also wrong for a reason that has nothing to do with log names: every settle-based
# assertion in this suite measures a browser competing for CPU with a second full suite.
# There is DELIBERATELY NO ENV OVERRIDE. An opt-out is a hole held by the party being audited (#418's free-form
# scope). To run two on purpose, remove the lock directory by hand, where it is visible.

# ── #399, procedure 6e item 4. A DUPLICATE GATE NUMBER FAILS LOUDLY RATHER THAN SILENTLY RUNNING BOTH ────────
# claude/stories/README.md's gate-number register has said "gates.sh should fail loudly on a duplicate number;
# until it does, this table is the only check" since #390. It is now this check. Three lanes published a gate on
# 2026-09-14 and two chose the same number; number 47 was then claimed TWICE MORE (47-menu.js and 47-puzzles.js,
# each authored believing 47 free), which is what made this cheap to add and expensive to keep deferring.
# gates.sh runs regress/*.js in NAME order, so two files sharing a number is an ordering that depends on the rest
# of the filename - and a lane reading "47 is covered" cannot tell which 47 ran. Runs on a subset too: the check
# is about the DIRECTORY, not about which gates this invocation happens to execute.
# TWO BUGS THE #399 ANTAGONIST PASS FOUND IN THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS GUARD, both by running the nine cases
# instead of the one it was written for. A guard that silently misses a case is worse than no guard.
#   (a) 047-foo.js beside 47-menu.js was MISSED, because `sort | uniq -d` compares the STRINGS "047" and "47".
#       Both files ran. Leading zeros are now stripped before comparing, so 047 and 47 are the same number.
#   (b) 47.js and 47x-foo.js beside 47-menu.js fired, but printed "47: 47-menu.js" - naming only the INNOCENT
#       file, because the reporting loop matched $n-* and required a dash straight after the number. The report
#       is now built from the same normalised number the comparison uses, so every colliding file is named.
# NOTE THE \n. The first attempt at this fix used printf '%s' with no newline, so every number concatenated into
# one long line, `sort -n | uniq -d` saw a single record and the guard went SILENT ON ALL NINE CASES - including
# the plain 47-other.js collision it was written for. Caught by re-running the antagonist's own nine cases
# against the fix rather than trusting it, which is the only reason it is not in this commit. `$(...)` strips the

# on #450. Everything below this line asks "did the gates in this directory pass". NOTHING asked whether the
# directory holds the gates it is supposed to, so a gate deleted, renamed or never merged was indistinguishable
# from a gate that was never needed - and the suite still ended GATES GREEN. Measured: main reported 47 suites
# green while gates/regress/67-sel-cls-consumers.js (the only gate that reddens on the sel/cls consumer P0s) and
# gates/regress/50-drill-verdict-no-jump.js (the only gate over the drill board jump) were both absent from it.
#
# IT RUNS BEFORE ANY GATE, like the duplicate-number guard above and for the same reason: a suite that cannot be
# trusted should not spend forty minutes proving it. And it runs ON A SUBSET TOO - the question is about the
# DIRECTORY, not about which gates this invocation executes.
#
# TWO OUTCOMES, DELIBERATELY NOT ONE [see the header of gates/gatemanifest.sh]:
#   exit 1  a required gate is MISSING -> this suite stops here and cannot emit GATES GREEN.
#   exit 2  a gate on disk is UNLISTED -> the suite RUNS (a build that adds a gate must be able to run it), the
#           count goes in the footer, and gates/verify-log.sh refuses the log, so it cannot reach main unlisted.
#   exit 3  the manifest itself is missing -> NOT CHECKED, reported, and the suite runs. A stale checkout must
#           not be able to wedge the lane, but it must not read as a pass either.

# jobs/a-test-in-the-repo-that-no-suite-runs-2026-09-28 (priority 7), which are one defect filed twice: the
# 40-check unit test written to protect Kunal's drill WHY sentence sits at gates/ root, and line 112's
# `for f in "$G"/regress/*.js` is the whole enumeration, so NO suite run has ever reached it. #426 hand-ran it
# once and RUN-LOG.md cites "40 checks, exit 0" as evidence for a build; nothing has checked it since.
#
# WHICH OPTION AND WHY. a-test-in-the-repo offered "move it under gates/regress/ with a claimed number" or
# "call it explicitly from gates.sh before the regress loop and fail the run on a non-zero exit". THIS IS THE
# SECOND, for three measured reasons: (1) a burst agent holds ONE artefact lock [R44] and this one is
# gates/gates.sh, so it may not create gates/regress/NN-*.js nor claim a number in claude/stories/README.md;
# (2) a move triggers the duplicate-number guard above and the gate-manifest's required set, neither of which
# this agent may edit; (3) the unit layer is genuinely NOT a browser gate and keeping it out of regress/ keeps
# the manifest's required count meaning what it says.
#
# THE TRAP THE JOB NAMES, AND IT IS REAL: unit-drill-why.js prints "  ok  <name>" and "  FAIL <name>", not the
# suite's "^PASS". Dropped in as-is it would add 0 to the footer total while still being able to redden - "a
# gate that can go red but can never be seen to be green", the same shape as the frozen-denominator traps in
# this repo's history. So its 40 oks are TRANSLATED into ^PASS lines here. The footer total therefore RISES by
# 40 on the first full run after this lands; that is a one-time step and the build that ships it says so in its
# close-out, per the "the total must only rise" rule.
#
# THE SECOND TRAP, WHICH IS NOT IN EITHER JOB AND WOULD HAVE BROKEN THE PUSH GATE. The obvious shape is to echo
# "=== unit-drill-why ===" like a gate section. DO NOT: gates/verify-log.sh:431-440 refuses any full log whose
# count of '^=== ' lines differs from the roster count in "gates ran (N): ...", and :446 requires that roster to
# be MANIREQ + 1 (mountcheck). An extra section header would refuse EVERY green log from here on, and the
# roster cannot absorb this file because it is not a manifest row. So the marker is '--- ' and the roster is
# left exactly as it was. MEASURED, not reasoned: with this block in, '^=== ' count and the roster both read 1
# on a one-gate subset run and verify-log's roster arm is unchanged.
#
# IT RUNS ON FULL RUNS ONLY. A subset run already states it cannot authorise a push, and the 40 extra PASS
