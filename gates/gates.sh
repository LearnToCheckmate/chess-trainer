# gates/gates.sh "#373"                          THE GATE IS ONE SCRIPT (supervisor ruling, HANDOFF 0c).
# gates/gates.sh "#373" "20-review 21-review-brilliant"    a SUBSET, for the iteration loop only.
#
# Runs gates/mountcheck.js FIRST (HANDOFF gate 3: it catches a stale or unmountable bundle in seconds), then every
# gates/regress/*.js in name order, one at a time with nothing else running (measurements are timing-sensitive).
# Each gate's output goes to gates/logs/<N>-<gate>.log and all of it to gates/logs/<N>-all.log. Exit 1 on any FAIL
# line, any "<<<" marker, or a non-zero exit. The footer prints the PASS-line count (the charter's "regression
# assertions" number, must only rise) and GATES GREEN / GATES RED. A build is "gated" only when the log ends GREEN.
#   CT_EXPECT is passed to mountcheck as the stamp the bundle must carry (defaults to $1).
#
# ── #391, procedure 6e item 1. SUBSET RUNS, AND THE ONE RULE THAT MATTERS ─────────────────────────────────────
# $2 is an optional space-separated list of gate basenames (globs allowed: "3*" or "20-review 4*"). Unset means
# every gate, exactly as before, so nothing that exists changes behaviour. mountcheck ALWAYS runs.
#
# **A SUBSET RUN NEVER AUTHORISES A PUSH.** It is for diagnosing a red, checking a fix, or proving a new gate.
# The full suite still runs from the top before every push.
#
# The guard is not a comment, it is mechanical: a subset run CANNOT EMIT THE STRING "GATES GREEN". Every consumer
# in this project greps for exactly that - this session does it dozens of times a day - so a subset log is
# unusable as a push gate by every reader that already exists, including ones nobody remembers to update. A
# subset also writes to a DIFFERENT FILE (<N>-subset-all.log) so it can never overwrite or be mistaken for the
# full log, and its header and footer both say so. `gates/verify-log.sh <log>` is the one place that decides
# whether a log authorises a push; run it on any log before citing one.
#
# Why this exists: an external challenger caught a log footed "GATES GREEN #387" filed under a 388-all.log name
# (fixed at #389, see claude/agents/gatelogs/README.md). A subset log passed off as a full one is that same
# failure with a far bigger blast radius, because a subset can be green while the gate that would have caught
# the regression never ran at all.

# ── #399, procedure 6e item 4. A DUPLICATE GATE NUMBER FAILS LOUDLY RATHER THAN SILENTLY RUNNING BOTH ────────
# claude/stories/README.md's gate-number register has said "gates.sh should fail loudly on a duplicate number;
# until it does, this table is the only check" since #390. It is now this check. Three lanes published a gate on
# 2026-09-14 and two chose the same number; number 47 was then claimed TWICE MORE (47-menu.js and 47-puzzles.js,
# each authored believing 47 free), which is what made this cheap to add and expensive to keep deferring.
# gates.sh runs regress/*.js in NAME order, so two files sharing a number is an ordering that depends on the rest
# of the filename - and a lane reading "47 is covered" cannot tell which 47 ran. Runs on a subset too: the check
# is about the DIRECTORY, not about which gates this invocation happens to execute.
# TWO BUGS THE #399 ANTAGONIST PASS FOUND IN THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS GUARD, both by running the nine cases
# instead of the one it was written for. A guard that silently misses a case is worse than no guard.
#   (a) 047-foo.js beside 47-menu.js was MISSED, because `sort | uniq -d` compares the STRINGS "047" and "47".
#       Both files ran. Leading zeros are now stripped before comparing, so 047 and 47 are the same number.
#   (b) 47.js and 47x-foo.js beside 47-menu.js fired, but printed "47: 47-menu.js" - naming only the INNOCENT
#       file, because the reporting loop matched $n-* and required a dash straight after the number. The report
#       is now built from the same normalised number the comparison uses, so every colliding file is named.
# NOTE THE \n. The first attempt at this fix used printf '%s' with no newline, so every number concatenated into
# one long line, `sort -n | uniq -d` saw a single record and the guard went SILENT ON ALL NINE CASES - including
# the plain 47-other.js collision it was written for. Caught by re-running the antagonist's own nine cases
# against the fix rather than trusting it, which is the only reason it is not in this commit. `$(...)` strips the
# trailing newline, so the equality test below is unaffected.
