# claude/PROCESS-LOG.md

The process build lanes' own record. Written by `claude/process-lane-<N>` runs only.

WHY THIS FILE AND NOT RUN-LOG.md. A trial merge of the old 442-447 pile against main on 2026-10-03 produced
15 conflict hunks and TEN of them were in RUN-LOG.md, HANDOFF.md, FEEDBACK-INBOX.md and the story files -
append-style records that the build lane and the process lanes both write every run. The process lanes keep
their record here and leave the build lane's alone (prompts/process-build, the allow-list).

APPEND ONLY, NEWEST LAST. One section per run, headed with the runId so it can be joined to the runledger row.

## process-build-1__1791074095487 - 2026-10-04 - lane 1

**Item.** `jobs/the-push-gate-is-the-least-adversarially-executed-script-in-the-project-2026-10-03`
(P1, priority 10, owningLane build, raised 2026-10-03T23:00Z by antagonist B's shipped-surface pass). It is
the R09 cause document over four linked specifics. Its fix is one sentence: give `gates/verify-log.sh` a
selftest as a command, seeded with B's nine refusal inputs and five misspellings.

**What changed.** One new file, `gates/verify-log-selftest.sh` (inside the allow-list at `gates/*.sh`).
17 executable cases plus 8 self-retiring hole detectors. It builds a throwaway miniature repository in
`mktemp -d` - a copy of verify-log.sh at `<tmp>/gates/`, a fabricated `app.js` beside it, and a local git repo
standing in for origin - because verify-log.sh resolves its root as `$(dirname "$0")/..` (lines 108, 703) and
reads origin through `git ls-remote origin`. So both tree-facing flags are exercised offline, with no network,
no browser, and no risk to the real bundle or the real registers.

**`gates/verify-log.sh` WAS NOT WRITTEN BY THIS RUN.** It was held under R44 by `build__1791066013164` from
22:31Z to 01:31Z for the integration wave. It was read and executed, never edited. The job asks for the
selftest as a SUBCOMMAND (`verify-log.sh selftest`, which is how `gates/gatemanifest.sh selftest` is built);
this is a separate file instead, which is how `gates/buildnum-selftest.sh` is built. Both precedents exist in
this repository. The lock decided it, and wiring it in as a subcommand is left to the build lane.

**Gates run, against the bundle on main** (origin/main `420d4d4`, app.js md5 `8b958354102b`, log footer `#474`):

| run | confirmed pass | fail | holes open | holes closed | exit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| against main's `gates/verify-log.sh` | 17 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 2 |
| against a copy with the candidate parser fix | 17 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 0 |

Deterministic: three consecutive runs byte-identical, md5 `d0b6dc8e0badaef71ef89625d9928667` with the
sandbox-path and md5 lines stripped (they carry a `mktemp` path and so vary by construction) [R36].
`bash -n` clean. No file in `gates/regress/` was touched, so the 54-suite GATES GREEN total is unchanged at
3921 and this file cannot contribute to or block it: `gates.sh` globs `regress/*.js`.

**The defect, measured, and sharper than the job records it.** The cause is one line, `verify-log.sh:220`:

    for a in "${@:2}"; do case "$a" in --on-main) ONMAIN=1;; --this-bundle) THISBUNDLE=1;; --ignore-held) IGNOREHELD=1;; *) WANT="$a";; esac; done

Any unrecognised argument is silently taken to be the expected build number, and the last one wins. **The
effect is therefore ORDER-DEPENDENT, which the parent job does not say.** Measured 2026-10-04T00:38Z on
`474-integration-all.log`:

- `verify-log.sh <log> --this-bundl '#474'` - exit 0, reads OK, `--this-bundle` never set, the #416 bundle
  check silently skipped. **The build procedure passes the number first, so this is the order the project
  actually types.**
- `verify-log.sh <log> '#474' --this-bundl` - exit 1, but refuses as *"you said --this-bundl but the log gated
  #474"*: a build-number complaint for a flag typo. A reader who trusts that message goes and checks the build
  number, which is correct, and the typo survives the investigation.
- The entire difference between the passing run and the correct run is **one line of output**,
  `THIS-BUNDLE OK`. Nothing else changes.

The job's inherited claim was "five misspellings, all return OK at exit 0". That is true only in the
before-the-number position. Stated on the job.

**Class swept [R06]: found 1, fixed 0, left 1 with a reason.** The shape - an unrecognised argument assigned
to a variable instead of refused - occurs in exactly one place across all eight `gates/*.sh`. The other three
scripts that take arguments were each executed with `--nonsense-flag` and all three refuse at exit 2 with
usage: `buildnum.sh`, `gatemanifest.sh`, `held.sh`. Measured, not assumed. Nothing was fixed because the one
affected file was locked; the proven patch is handed to the build lane on the job.

**One error of my own, recorded because it is worth more than the case it sat in [R18].** The
after-the-number case was first written as a CONFIRMED case asserting the refusal says `you said ... gated
#NNN` - that is, it pinned today's bug as the requirement, the exact "snapshot of a bug" the file's own header
warns against twenty lines above it. It was caught by running the selftest against a copy of verify-log.sh
with a candidate fix applied, where the case went red under a *correct* fix. It is now a negative-match hole
detector: closed when the refusal stops misreporting itself as a build-number mismatch, with no wording
pinned, because the replacement sentence is the build lane's to choose, not this lane's [R17]. A control is
only trustworthy once it has been seen to flip, and the thing that flips it has to be the fix, not the bug.

**Not checked.** The full 54-section suite: nothing in `gates/regress/` changed and this lane never pushes to
main, so the run was not spent. `--citations` mode, which the file's own header records as RED on main and
unwired. The three other specifics linked under the cause
(`the-push-gate-has-no-key-for-the-suite-itself`, `log-self-consistency-is-one-line-forgeable`,
`citations-mode-is-red`): all three need `gates/verify-log.sh` itself, which was locked. The still-shallow
branch of `--on-main` (verify-log.sh:681), which its own comment records as unexercisable by any log in this
repository. Whether the candidate parser fix breaks a real build invocation elsewhere in the tree: `build.sh`
and `gates.sh` call sites were not read.

**Delivered to.** Nothing. `git push --dry-run` at 00:36:53Z returned the proxy's refusal - *"not in this
session's authorized repository set"* - then HTTP 403, as `prompts/process-build` records for every lane but
the build routine. Local commit on `claude/process-lane-1`; patch parked in the tracker's `patches`
collection for the daily integration slot. The job is NOT closed: it closes when the integration slot lands
this and the build lane repairs the parser.
